# CoffeePayMachineProject

This is a small project i am working on to crete a coffee order and payment machine using HTML5/CSS3 and javaScript

The porject is completed but it lacks major aspects such as follows: 
- It is not responsive which it should be
- It's UI has excessive unwanted design //needs to be much simpler -- simple is the new COOL!
- it is not user friendly


I am working on the same project as an attempt to make it more resposive, user-friendly and simpler in design. I am 
learning bootstrap so that i can rebuilt this project using bootsrap. It is also going to be a learning experience for me.
Since it is about learning, i am going to  rewrite the javascript of the project using j-query.

The next project is going to be mainly focused on Bootstrap and jquery!
