# CoffeePayMachineProject

This is a small project that i was working on. It is a simple coffee order and payment machine using HTML5/CSS3 and javaScript. 
This project is solely for learning purpose. 

The project is completed but it lacks major aspects such as follows: 
- It is not responsive.
- It's UI has excessive unwanted design. The design needs to be much simpler.
- it is not user friendly.
