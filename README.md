# CoffeePayMachineProject

This is a small project that i was working on. It is a simple coffee order and payment machine using HTML5/CSS3 and javaScript. 
This project is solely for learning purpose. 

The porject is completed but it lacks major aspects such as follows: 
- It is not responsive which it should be.
- It's UI has excessive unwanted design //needs to be much simpler -- simple is the new COOL!
- it is not user friendly


I am rewriting the same project as an attempt to make it more resposive, user-friendly and simpler in design. I am 
learning bootstrap framework so that i can rebuilt this project using bootsrap. It is going to be a learning experience for me.
Since it is about learning, i am also going to  rewrite the entire javaScript of the project using jQuery.

The next project is going to be mainly focused on Bootstrap framework and jQuery!
